Project Overview: Uber Rides and Weather

Objective: Investigate the relationship between weather conditions and Uber ride frequency to understand how temperature extremes affect commuter habits and surge-pricing strategies. This project will provide valuable insights into how weather affects Uber ride frequency, commuter habits, and potential strategies for surge pricing based on temperature extremes.

Data Sources:

Uber ride data from Kaggle Climate data from the National Centers for Environmental Information

Key Questions:

Do people take more Uber rides during summer and winter months compared to other seasons?
Is there a correlation between daily temperature and Uber ride frequency?
How does precipitation affect the frequency of Uber rides?
How can the findings inform surge-pricing strategies and provide insights into commuter habits?
Methodology:

Collect and preprocess Uber ride data and climate data Analyze ride frequency by season to identify patterns in summer and winter months Examine the relationship between daily temperature and ride frequency using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques Interpret results to draw conclusions about commuter habits and surge-pricing strategies
